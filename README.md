# Project Description

Mailboxd is a site where users can rate and review movies on a scale of 1-5 with text input. A play on the site Letterboxd, users are able to see posters and a description for each movie, sourced from the TMDB API, as well as others’ reviews. The site allows them to log movies they’ve watched, providing a ‘diary’ of sorts to journal their thoughts and share them.

Unauthenticated users can search for movies and see reviews others have left on these films. Authenticated users, meanwhile, can set up a profile and choose a custom username, along with logging movies, providing them with a rating and review if so inclined. They can also add movies to a watchlist.
